## Module 1. The Site Class

directory = self.dest / path.relative_to(self.source)

    * The Path class has a __truediv__ method that returns another Path.
    * You can do the same with your own classes.

## Module 2. The Parser Class

extensions: List[str] = []

    * This is called an `annotation` of an empty List.
